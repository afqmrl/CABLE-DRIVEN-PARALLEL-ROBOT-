# Asset Directory

This folder is used to organize external and supporting resources for the Cable-Driven Parallel Robot project.

## 📁 Subdirectories

- **assets/**  
  General-purpose resources such as images, tag templates, or visual assets.  

- **scservo_sdk/**  
  Contains SDK libraries and scripts for interfacing with SCServo motors. Useful for initializing, controlling, or reading feedback from Dynamixel-style servo motors.  

- **sms_sts/**  
  Reserved for scripts and configuration files related to SMS-STS servos or control modules.  

- **saved_commands/**  
  Stores pre-recorded motor command sequences, scripts, or configuration profiles for testing and replay.

> ⚠️ Note: These folders currently include `.gitkeep` placeholder files to ensure Git tracks the structure. As files are added (code, SDKs, configs), you can remove `.gitkeep` if no longer needed.

## 🔧 Usage

Use this folder to keep motor SDKs, calibration files, or test data organized and version-controlled.  
Each subdirectory can grow independently based on your robot’s motor hardware or command pipeline.
